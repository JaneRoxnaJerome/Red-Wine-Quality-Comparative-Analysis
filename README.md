# Red-Wine-Quality-A-comparative-analysis-of-classifier-models

Introduction:

This project revolves around a dataset concerning wine quality, encompassing diverse chemical attributes like acidity, sugar content, pH level, and alcohol percentage. Additionally, it includes a quality rating ranging from 3 to 9, where higher values denote superior quality, along with the wine's color classification (red or white). The primary aim is to employ data mining methodologies, specifically multiple regression models and classification tree methods, to forecast wine quality.

The project will utilize Python, leveraging packages such as sklearn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. The outlined steps involve:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to eliminate missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Determining Data Mining Task: Opting for classification technique.
Determining Data Mining Technique: Employing the multiple linear regression model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the chosen model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
Deployment of the Best Technique/Model: Applying the selected model to new data records.
